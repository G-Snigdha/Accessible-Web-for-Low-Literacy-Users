            Climate change poses significant challenges to global ecosystems and human societies. Rising temperatures lead to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events. This affects agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity worldwide. Scientists are working on various solutions, including renewable energy adoption, carbon capture technologies, and sustainable farming practices. International cooperation and policy changes are crucial for addressing these challenges effectively. Communities around the world are already implementing adaptation strategies to cope with changing environmental conditions. Educational initiatives are also being developed to raise awareness about climate change and promote sustainable practices at individual and institutional levels.
